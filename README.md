The Agentic Marketing Assistant is an intuitive tool powered by Claude Sonnet 3.7, designed to transform real company data into actionable insights accessible to both technical and non-technical users. Recognizing that businesses often struggle to rapidly and efficiently extract meaning from complex datasets, we built an assistant that seamlessly integrates real-time data from sources such as Claritas' PRIZM segmentation and Salesforce's live sales figures. Users simply query the assistant in natural language, prompting it to retrieve relevant data from a structured MySQL database, analyze it using Claude's sophisticated reasoning, and deliver clear marketing recommendations through a straightforward user interface. Technically, the system leverages virtual data storage and API-based interactions, ensuring effortless scalability and consistent performance across diverse platforms. These deliberate design choices allow easy reproduction and deployment, effectively bridging complex analytics and actionable business decisions.
